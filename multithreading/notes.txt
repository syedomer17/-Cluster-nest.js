ðŸ§  What Is Multithreading?
Node.js runs JavaScript in a single thread by default. However, CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., file processing, large data computations) can block the main thread and slow down your app.

To solve this, we use multithreading to run these heavy tasks in parallel worker threads without freezing the main app.

ðŸš€ NestJS & Multithreading: How It Works
NestJS is built on top of Node.js, so it can use:

worker_threads module (native Node.js threads)

Or manage multiple processes using PM2 clustering 

ðŸ§° When to Use This?
Use multithreading in NestJS when:

You need to process large files, math-heavy logic, or batch operations

You want to avoid blocking the main event loop
